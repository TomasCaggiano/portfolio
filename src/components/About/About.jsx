      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Tomas Caggiano, a Front-end Developer based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have completed several specialized courses that have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in web development. My journey in technology began with a diploma in Web Development, where I mastered the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Git, and GitHub. This solid foundation allowed me to build aesthetically pleasing and functional web pages.
      Following this, I delved into JavaScript, gaining a deep understanding of its syntax and practical applications in web development. I learned to manage control structures, functions, objects, and arrays, and I explored advanced concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, local storage, JSON data exchange, and asynchronous techniques such as promises, Ajax, and Fetch.
      My educational journey culminated with a diploma in ReactJS, where I acquired proficiency in JSX, component-based architecture, state management, routing, and hooks. I also gained hands-on experience with Firebase, enhancing my ability to build robust and scalable web applications.
      Throughout my learning path, I have developed a keen interest in Node.js and Visual Studio Code, which have become essential tools in my development workflow. I am continuously exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
      I am currently seeking my first professional opportunity in the field of Front-end Development, where I can apply my skills and passion to create impactful digital experiences. I am eager to join a dynamic team that values innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
      Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities!</p>
